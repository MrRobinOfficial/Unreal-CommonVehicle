## üìù Quick guide

To get started with this plugin, you can effortlessly extend either the `ACarPawn` or `ACarDriveablePawn` classes. The `ACarDriveablePawn` class provides additional functionality for handling input and camera movement, enhancing the control and immersive experience.

Furthermore, it is recommended to configure the input actions using the Enhanced Input system, which has been officially adopted since Unreal Engine version **5.1**. This system replaces the deprecated input system and offers improved features and flexibility.

Once you have completed the configuration and setup process, your chaos vehicle is ready to go! If you need assistance with setting up animations, engine curves, or physics, we have a helpful video tutorial available for you to [_watch_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR3sSMD-D0E) by **LeafBranchGames**.

Now that your chaos vehicle is complete, you can further enhance its functionality by tweaking it in the blueprint editor. To explore the wide range of features and possibilities offered by this plugin, we **recommend** reading the detailed `Overview` section or exploring the comprehensive documentation available in our GitHub repository.

_Unleash the full potential of your chaos vehicle and delve into the extensive functionality provided by this plugin. Enjoy the immersive experience and create captivating projects with ease._
